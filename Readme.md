# Agenda Manager with Marten and ASP.NET Core

This is a demo application for an Agenda manager (yes, a todo app) that uses ASP.NET Core and RavenDB. 

To get started you'll need to run a Postgres instance.

You'll need to initialize the database, and create a new database called **"productivity"** and change the connection string in `appsettings.json`.

From there you can run this project.

## Notes

- Created using [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider)
- Used JetBrains AI Assistant for some Bootstrap and JQuery stuff
- Ported from the RavenDB example on main.
- Application assumes one user but could be made to support multiple users with the addition of identity.
